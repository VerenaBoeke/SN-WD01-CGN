* First "hard-code" some number in the program (write the number into a variable). You can call this variable secret.
* Then the user has to find out what this number is (using input()). Store user's guess in a variable called guess.
* Check if your secret is equal to user's guess.
* If the user's guess is wrong, let him/her know that (use print() and if/else).
* If the user's guess is correct, congratulate him/her.
